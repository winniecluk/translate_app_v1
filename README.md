Hi! Welcome to my first Rails app. I'm making an online 
bidding system for translation projects. Clients will upload 
documents they need translated, and then translators 
bid on them. Client will be able to compare bids and translators' 
qualifications, and then assign each project to a vendor.

This is still a work in progress. Check back later!
